# 🗺️ U.S. States Game 🇺🇸  

A **Python-based geography game** that helps users learn U.S. state names by placing them on a map.  
This game was built to **practice Python skills** and to help my little brother learn geography in a fun, interactive way.  

🎯 Why I Built This
I created this game to:

Improve my programming skills using Python, Turtle, and Pandas.
Help my little brother learn geography in a fun and engaging way.
Make studying interactive by tracking missed states and generating a review list (CSV file).
